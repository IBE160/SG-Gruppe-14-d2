# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-12-02
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Risikostyring og Prosjektoppfølging i spillet (Risk Management and Project Monitoring in the game)

**Session Goals:** To identify key risks in a construction project and define how a player would monitor project progress within the game.

**Techniques Used:** 
1. "What If" Scenarios
2. Six Thinking Hats
3. Mind Mapping

**Total Ideas Generated:** 15+

### Key Themes Identified:
- The importance of balancing competing project constraints (time, cost, quality, safety).
- The need for leading indicators (e.g., overtime, weather) to predict future risks.
- The distinction between internal (human error, rushing) and external (strikes, market changes) risks.
- The desire for a central dashboard to monitor all critical project aspects.

## Technique Sessions

### 1. "What If" Scenarios (Risk Identification)
- **What if you had unlimited resources?** -> Still need to monitor **Personal Injuries**.
- **What if the opposite of delays were true (ahead of schedule)?** -> This could lead to **"Slurv" (Sloppiness/Quality Issues)** and **Resource Shortages** due to supply chain misalignment.
- **What if human error didn't exist?** -> Focus shifts to external risks like **Strikes**, supplier bankruptcy, extreme weather, and regulatory changes.

### 2. Six Thinking Hats (Deep Dive on "Personskader")
- **White Hat (Facts):** Can be measured in **"Skadetimer"** (lost work hours).
- **Red Hat (Feelings):** The project manager would feel **"irritert og oppgitt"** (irritated and frustrated).
- **Black Hat (Risks):** Increased injuries lead to **project delays** and the need to renegotiate the project.
- **Yellow Hat (Benefits of Mitigation):** Leads to **efficient work without unexpected stops**.
- **Green Hat (Solutions):** Player can **reduce overtime** or **implement new safety solutions** (even at the cost of some efficiency).

### 3. Mind Mapping (Prosjektoppfølging Dashboard)
- **Central Theme:** Prosjektoppfølging (Project Monitoring)
- **Main Branches & Sub-points:**
    - **Økonomi (Economy):**
        - Totalkostnad vs. Budsjett
    - **Fremdrift (Progress):**
        - Projisert Sluttdato
        - Milepæl-oversikt
        - WBS-status (Gantt-view)
    - **Kvalitet (Quality):**
        - Kvalitetskontroll på mottatte materialer
        - Kvalitetskontroll på utført arbeid
    - **Risiko (Risk):**
        - Monitor for personskader (Skadetimer, overtid)
        - Monitor for ressursmangel
        - Monitor for eksterne hendelser (streik, etc.)

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities
_Ideas ready to implement now_

- **MVP Implementation:** As defined by the user, the most crucial first step is to build a basic but functional application to demonstrate the core loop. This includes:
    - A basic frontend to display project data (WBS) and handle communication with AI agents.
    - A backend to manage API calls to the AI agents.
    - Ensuring all technical specifications are met for this core functionality.

### Future Innovations
_Ideas requiring development/research_

- A detailed **quality management system** that tracks specific types of flaws and rework.
- A **supply chain simulation** that models lead times and the risk of resource shortages dynamically.
- A **reputation system** where high safety scores (low "skadetimer") give tangible benefits in future negotiations or insurance costs.

### Moonshots
_Ambitious, transformative concepts_

- An AI-driven system that **proactively suggests risk mitigation strategies** based on leading indicators, rather than just displaying data.
- A simulation of **complex external events** like market-wide material price fluctuations or political shifts that impact the project.

## Action Planning

### Top Priority Idea
- **#1 Priority:** Build the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- **Rationale:** To create a tangible prototype that demonstrates the core application loop: data display (WBS), AI communication, and the basic front/backend structure. This is essential to validate the concept and provide a platform for future development.
- **Next steps:** Define detailed technical specifications for the front-end, back-end, and API communication protocol.

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- The combination of a broad technique ("What If") followed by more structured techniques (Six Hats, Mind Mapping) was effective.
- Starting with a high-level risk ("Personskader") and drilling down into its causes, consequences, and mitigation strategies provided a full-circle view.

### Areas for Further Exploration
- The **"Kvalitet"** and **"Risiko"** branches of the Mind Map could be detailed further in a future session.
- The mechanics of how a player **renegotiates a project** after a major delay or cost overrun.
