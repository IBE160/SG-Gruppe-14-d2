#### Pain Relievers (How the simulation addresses pains)

**Severe Pains Addressed:**
1. **Theory-Practice Gap →** *AI-Driven Negotiation Loop*
   - Instead of static numbers, students must actively negotiate with AI suppliers who behave like real stakeholders
   - The simulation forces students to experience the iterative, chaotic nature of real planning

2. **No Soft Skills Practice →** *Persona-Driven AI Behavior*
   - AI suppliers have distinct personalities (stubborn architect, profit-driven contractor, detail-oriented engineer)
   - Students must adapt their negotiation approach to each persona's motivations
   - Dialogue system rewards referencing requirements specs and making data-driven arguments

3. **Static Data →** *Dynamic Estimate Generation*
   - Initial supplier quotes are intentionally inflated and exceed project constraints
   - Students cannot proceed without actively negotiating to bring estimates down
   - Success requires strategic thinking about which suppliers to push and which to accept

**Moderate Pains Addressed:**
4. **Delayed Feedback →** *Real-Time Plan Validation*
   - Dashboard continuously shows current budget vs. 700 MNOK limit
   - System immediately alerts when plan exceeds constraints
   - Students see consequences of each negotiation decision instantly

5. **Generic Scenarios →** *Authentic Case Study Integration*
   - Built on actual LOG565 case study (Hædda Barneskole) that students already study
   - Uses real project documents (WBS, requirements spec) from the course
   - AI references specific requirements (e.g., TEK17, F-002) during negotiations

**Minor Pains Addressed:**
6. **Time Constraints →** *Focused Scope*
   - MVP focuses solely on Planning Phase (not execution, monitoring, closing)
   - Target completion time: under 45-60 minutes
   - No unnecessary features that dilute the core learning objective

7. **Lack of Safe Experimentation →** *Unlimited Retries*
   - Students can renegotiate at any time without penalty
   - Failed plans provide clear feedback on what to fix
   - No "game over" - just guidance on what to adjust

8. **Limited Replayability →** *AI Variability*
   - AI suppliers don't give identical responses each playthrough
   - Students can experiment with different negotiation strategies
   - (Future: Difficulty settings, random events, different starting scenarios)

#### Gain Creators (How the simulation enables gains)

**Essential Gains Enabled:**
1. **Practical Confidence →** *Completion Achievement*
   - Successfully negotiating all suppliers and submitting a valid plan provides concrete proof of capability
   - Students can say "I managed a 700 MNOK project plan under strict constraints" in interviews

2. **Negotiation Skills →** *Diverse Supplier Personas*
   - Each AI persona requires different negotiation tactics (appeal to architect's aesthetics, contractor's profit, engineer's technical logic)
   - Students discover through practice which arguments work with which personas
   - Negotiation log provides evidence of strategies used

**Important Gains Enabled:**
3. **Immediate Feedback →** *Validation Engine*
   - Real-time constraint checking (budget, timeline, dependencies)
   - Clear error messages: "Plan exceeds budget by 50 MNOK - renegotiate items X, Y, Z"
   - Success state: "Plan Approved! You completed the project within all constraints"

4. **Realistic Scenarios →** *Document-Grounded AI*
   - AI prompts include actual WBS and requirements data
   - Suppliers reference specific requirements during negotiation ("F-002 requires X, which costs Y")
   - Feels like negotiating with real stakeholders who have read the project docs

5. **Portfolio Artifacts →** *Exportable Results*
   - Completed project plan (Gantt-ready data)
   - Negotiation history log showing the full conversation with each supplier
   - Students can screenshot or export to include in portfolios or discuss in class

**Nice-to-Have Gains Enabled:**
6. **Iterative Learning →** *Cyclical Workflow*
   - Negotiate → Review Plan → Exceed Constraints → Renegotiate → Repeat
   - Students viscerally experience that planning isn't "fill in the template once and submit"
   - Dashboard makes dependencies clear (can't start råbygg until grunnarbeid is scheduled)

7. **Time Efficiency →** *Streamlined UX*
   - No unnecessary tutorials or cutscenes
   - Direct access to all project documents in-app
   - Chat-based interface minimizes clicks and navigation

8. **Safe Failure →** *No Permanent Consequences*
   - Plans aren't submitted to professors unless student chooses to
   - Can restart negotiations without losing progress on other WBS items
   - Experimentation is encouraged: "Try offering a bonus for early completion and see how the contractor responds"

### 3.6 Success Metrics (How We Measure Value Delivery)

#### User Engagement Metrics

**UE-1: Completion Rate**
- **Definition:** % of users who start the simulation and successfully submit a valid plan (within budget and timeline)
- **Target (MVP):** ≥ 60% completion rate
- **Rationale:** If the simulation is too difficult or frustrating, students will abandon it. 60% allows for challenge while ensuring most students can succeed with effort.
- **Measurement:** Track `games.status = 'completed'` vs. `games.status = 'in_progress'` or `'abandoned'`

**UE-2: Average Time to Completion**
- **Definition:** Mean time from first login to successful plan submission
- **Target (MVP):** 45-60 minutes
- **Rationale:** Aligns with the goal of a focused, time-efficient learning experience. Too fast suggests the simulation is trivial; too slow suggests it's tedious.
- **Measurement:** `games.completed_at - games.created_at` for completed games

**UE-3: Negotiation Iteration Count**
- **Definition:** Average number of messages exchanged with AI suppliers per WBS item before acceptance
- **Target (MVP):** 3-7 messages per supplier
- **Rationale:** Too few messages (1-2) suggests the simulation is too easy or students are accepting bad deals. Too many (>10) suggests the AI is too stubborn or the game is frustrating.
- **Measurement:** `COUNT(chat_logs WHERE wbs_item = X AND game_id = Y) / COUNT(DISTINCT wbs_items WHERE game_id = Y)`

**UE-4: Renegotiation Rate**
- **Definition:** % of users who renegotiate at least one WBS item after initially accepting a quote
- **Target (MVP):** ≥ 40%
- **Rationale:** Indicates students are experiencing the iterative planning process (realizing later that earlier decisions put them over budget).
- **Measurement:** Track changes to `plan_entries` for the same WBS item within a game

**UE-5: Retry Rate (Failed Plans)**
- **Definition:** % of users who submit a plan that fails validation (exceeds constraints) at least once before succeeding
- **Target (MVP):** 50-70%
- **Rationale:** The simulation should be challenging enough that most students don't get it perfect on the first try, forcing them to make trade-offs and renegotiate.
- **Measurement:** Track plan submissions that fail validation before final success

#### Learning Outcome Metrics

**LO-1: Negotiation Strategy Diversity**
- **Definition:** Variety of negotiation approaches used (e.g., referencing requirements, offering trade-offs, challenging assumptions, proposing alternatives)
- **Target (MVP):** ≥ 3 distinct strategies per user
- **Rationale:** Indicates students are experimenting with different tactics, not just repeating the same approach.
- **Measurement:** NLP analysis of `chat_logs` to classify negotiation tactics (e.g., "contains requirement reference", "proposes alternative solution", "appeals to persona motivation")

**LO-2: Constraint Awareness**
- **Definition:** % of users who proactively reference the 700 MNOK budget or May 2026 deadline in their negotiations
- **Target (MVP):** ≥ 70%
- **Rationale:** Indicates students understand and internalize the project constraints, using them as negotiation leverage.
- **Measurement:** Search `chat_logs` for mentions of "700", "MNOK", "budget", "May 2026", "deadline", etc.

**LO-3: Document Utilization Rate**
- **Definition:** % of users who reference WBS or Requirements Specification (krav-spec) during negotiations
- **Target (MVP):** ≥ 50%
- **Rationale:** Shows students are learning to use project documents as evidence in negotiations, not just negotiating based on intuition.
- **Measurement:** Track `chat_logs` for WBS item numbers (e.g., "1.3.1") or requirement codes (e.g., "F-002")

**LO-4: Trade-off Decision Making**
- **Definition:** % of users who successfully reduce costs on some items and accept slightly higher costs on others (strategic allocation)
- **Target (MVP):** ≥ 60%
- **Rationale:** Demonstrates understanding that not all negotiations can be won equally - PM requires strategic prioritization.
- **Measurement:** Compare final accepted quotes vs. WBS baseline estimates - did user push harder on some items than others?

#### User Satisfaction Metrics

**US-1: Post-Simulation Survey Score**
- **Definition:** Average rating on 5-point Likert scale for key questions:
  - "This simulation helped me understand project planning better than traditional case studies"
  - "I feel more confident in my ability to negotiate with project stakeholders"
  - "The AI suppliers felt realistic and challenging"
  - "I would recommend this simulation to other PM students"
- **Target (MVP):** ≥ 4.0/5.0 average across all questions
- **Measurement:** Optional survey after completing simulation

**US-2: Perceived Realism Score**
- **Definition:** User rating on "How realistic did the AI supplier negotiations feel?" (1-5 scale)
- **Target (MVP):** ≥ 3.8/5.0
- **Rationale:** The simulation's value depends on feeling authentic - too gamified or scripted undermines learning transfer.
- **Measurement:** Single survey question after completion

### 3.7 User Journey Map (Sara - The Academic Student)

**Phase 1: Discovery**
- **Context:** Sara's LOG565 professor announces the Nye Hædda simulation as an optional assignment (or extra credit, or exam preparation tool)
- **Thoughts:** "Another online tool? Is this going to be like those boring case study quizzes?"
- **Actions:** Reads the announcement, sees it's about negotiation, decides to try it
- **Feelings:** 😐 Skeptical but curious

**Phase 2: Onboarding**
- **Context:** Sara registers with university email, logs in, sees the project dashboard
- **Thoughts:** "Okay, 700 MNOK budget, 15 months... this is the Hædda case we studied in class!"
- **Actions:** Reviews the project constraints, clicks on the WBS view, sees the familiar work breakdown structure
- **Feelings:** 🙂 Relieved (it's related to course content, not random)

**Phase 3: First Contact**
- **Context:** Sara selects WBS item "Grunnarbeid" and chooses to contact the "Entreprenør Grunnarbeid"
- **Thoughts:** "I need a quote for the groundwork. How hard can this be?"
- **Actions:** Types: "Hi, I need a cost and duration estimate for WBS 1.3.1 Grunnarbeid"
- **AI Response:** "Understood. For Grunnarbeid, our estimate is 120 MNOK and 3 months. This accounts for current soil conditions and equipment availability."
- **Feelings:** 🤔 "Hmm, that seems high compared to the WBS baseline of 100 MNOK..."

**Phase 4: First Negotiation Attempt**
- **Context:** Sara tries to negotiate down the cost
- **Thoughts:** "Let me try to get a better deal. The budget is only 700 MNOK total."
- **Actions:** Types: "120 MNOK is over our budget estimate of 100 MNOK. Can you reduce it?"
- **AI Response:** "I understand budget constraints are tight. However, our estimate is based on realistic market rates for this scope of work. If you can provide more details on where the 100 MNOK baseline comes from, I can review it."
- **Feelings:** 😳 "Oh... the AI is pushing back. It wants me to justify my ask. I need to check the requirements spec."

**Phase 5: Document Research**
- **Context:** Sara opens the Requirements Specification (krav-spec.pdf) to find leverage
- **Thoughts:** "Maybe there's something in the requirements that reduces the work scope..."
- **Actions:** Finds Requirement F-003: "Grunnarbeid must account for rocky terrain. However, preliminary surveys indicate only 30% of the area is rocky, not the typical 50%."
- **Feelings:** 💡 "Aha! I can use this!"

**Phase 6: Evidence-Based Negotiation**
- **Context:** Sara returns to the chat with data
- **Actions:** Types: "According to Requirement F-003, preliminary surveys show only 30% rocky terrain, not 50%. Your estimate should account for this lower blasting requirement. Can you revise to 105 MNOK and 2.5 months?"
- **AI Response:** "Good catch. You're right - I had assumed 50% rocky terrain in my baseline. Let me adjust. I can do 105 MNOK, but I need to keep the duration at 3 months for safety margins. Alternatively, 2.5 months but at 110 MNOK to account for double shifts."
- **Feelings:** 😊 "Yes! It's working! The AI listened because I brought evidence. But now I have to choose between cost and time..."

**Phase 7: Trade-off Decision**
- **Context:** Sara weighs the options
- **Thoughts:** "If I save time here, I can start Råbygg earlier, which might save time overall. But 110 MNOK is still over the WBS estimate. Let me check the total budget impact."
- **Actions:** Checks dashboard - sees she has 600 MNOK remaining. Decides to accept 2.5 months at 110 MNOK.
- **Actions:** Types: "Accepted. 110 MNOK for 2.5 months with double shifts."
- **AI Response:** "Excellent. Confirmed: Grunnarbeid - 110 MNOK, 2.5 months. Looking forward to starting work."
- **Feelings:** 😌 "That felt like a real negotiation! I had to give a little to get a little."

**Phase 8: Plan Commitment & Realization**
- **Context:** Sara commits the terms to the plan. Dashboard updates.
- **Thoughts:** "Okay, 110/700 MNOK used. I have 14 more WBS items to negotiate... if they're all this tough, I'm going to go way over budget."
- **Actions:** Selects the next WBS item (Råbygg - Structural Work) and contacts the "Totalentreprenør"
- **Feelings:** 😰 "Oh no. The contractor wants 250 MNOK. The WBS estimate was 200 MNOK. I'm going to blow the budget..."

**Phase 9: Crisis & Iteration**
- **Context:** After negotiating 5 WBS items, Sara's total is 500 MNOK - and she's only halfway through the WBS
- **Thoughts:** "I need to go back and renegotiate the earlier items. I was too generous."
- **Actions:** Returns to "Grunnarbeid" negotiation. Types: "I need to revisit our agreement. Can we go back to 105 MNOK for 3 months? The overall project budget is tighter than I initially thought."
- **AI Response:** "I appreciate your transparency. Given our earlier discussion, I can agree to 105 MNOK for 3 months, but only if you confirm the order today so I can lock in my team's availability."
- **Feelings:** 😓 "This is stressful, but it's teaching me that planning isn't linear. You have to keep adjusting."

**Phase 10: Final Push & Success**
- **Context:** After 45 minutes of negotiating, renegotiating, and optimizing, Sara submits a plan: 698 MNOK, completion date May 10, 2026
- **Actions:** Clicks "Submit Plan"
- **System Response:** "✅ Plan Approved! Total Cost: 698 MNOK (within 700 MNOK budget). Completion Date: May 10, 2026 (5 days before deadline). Congratulations - you successfully managed the Nye Hædda project planning phase!"
- **Feelings:** 🎉 "YES! I actually did it! And I understand why the professor always says 'planning is iterative' now."

**Phase 11: Reflection**
- **Context:** Sara sees the post-simulation survey
- **Thoughts:** "That was way more useful than reading another case study. I actually felt like a project manager making tough calls."
- **Actions:** Fills out survey, rates 5/5 on "helped me understand planning", writes comment: "This should be mandatory for LOG565"
- **Feelings:** 😊 Satisfied, confident, eager to discuss in class

**Phase 12: Transfer to Real World**
- **Context:** One week later, Sara is in an exam. Question: "You receive an estimate from a contractor that exceeds your budget. Describe your negotiation approach."
- **Thoughts:** "Oh! This is exactly what I did in the simulation!"
- **Actions:** Writes a detailed answer referencing the need to validate estimates against requirements, propose trade-offs, and iterate on the plan.
- **Exam Grade:** Full marks on that question.
- **Feelings:** 😄 "The simulation actually prepared me for this!"

## 4. Key Themes & Insights

### Key Themes:

1. **Soft Skills Gap in PM Education:**
   - Traditional PM education focuses heavily on tools (Gantt charts, PERT, CPM) and light on negotiation, persuasion, and data validation
   - The most valuable learning happens in the "messy middle" of planning - the iterative back-and-forth that case studies skip

2. **Safe Experimentation Enables Learning:**
   - Users need permission to fail without consequences
   - The ability to retry, renegotiate, and experiment with different strategies is more valuable than getting it "right" the first time
   - Fear of real-world failure prevents learning through trial-and-error

3. **Authenticity Drives Engagement:**
   - Generic, abstract simulations feel like "just another assignment"
   - Using a real case study (Hædda) that students already study creates immediate relevance and context
   - AI personas must feel realistic (not scripted) to transfer learning to real-world situations

4. **Time as a Constraint AND a Feature:**
   - Students and professionals need focused, efficient learning experiences (not 10-hour simulations)
   - But the experience must be meaty enough to create genuine challenges (not a 10-minute quiz)
   - Sweet spot: 45-60 minutes for meaningful struggle followed by achievement

5. **Feedback Loops Accelerate Learning:**
   - Real-time validation (budget tracking, constraint checking) allows users to self-correct
   - Delayed feedback (waiting for exam results) misses the teachable moment
   - The simulation becomes a "learning companion" rather than a "testing mechanism"

6. **Persona-Driven AI Creates Depth:**
   - Different suppliers requiring different negotiation tactics prevents the simulation from feeling repetitive
   - Users must develop adaptive strategies, not just memorize "the right answer"
   - Persona diversity mirrors real-world stakeholder management

7. **Iteration Mirrors Reality:**
   - The best learning happens when users realize their early decisions were wrong (e.g., accepting 110 MNOK for grunnarbeid means they can't afford råbygg later)
   - The ability to renegotiate teaches that project plans are living documents
   - This is a lesson that static case studies cannot provide

### Insights & Learnings:

1. **The Simulation Fills a Specific Gap:**
   - It doesn't replace Gantt chart tools (MS Project) - it teaches what comes BEFORE you open MS Project
   - It doesn't replace theory (PMBOK) - it teaches how to apply theory when humans are involved
   - It doesn't replace case analysis - it teaches the messy data-gathering phase that cases skip

2. **Users Have Different Success Definitions:**
   - Students: Passing the course, being able to discuss in class
   - Career switchers: Confidence to take on first PM role, portfolio artifacts
   - Instructors: Student engagement, learning outcomes, ease of integration
   - The MVP must serve the primary user (students) while not alienating secondary users

3. **The Core Value is NOT "Learn Project Management":**
   - The core value is: "Practice the specific skills (negotiation, data validation, trade-offs) that PM courses teach in theory but never let you practice"
   - This is a narrower, more defensible value proposition than "general PM education"

4. **AI Realism is Make-or-Break:**
   - If the AI feels like a chatbot ("I can do anything you want!"), the simulation fails
   - If the AI feels robotic ("I will only accept exactly 105 MNOK"), the simulation feels frustrating
   - The AI must feel like a real human with constraints, motivations, and a negotiation strategy

5. **Success Metrics Must Measure Learning, Not Just Engagement:**
   - Completion rate is important, but not sufficient
   - We need to measure: Did users develop negotiation skills? Did they learn to iterate? Did they use evidence?
   - This requires qualitative analysis (chat logs, negotiation strategies) not just quantitative metrics (time to completion)

---

## 5. Action Plan

### Priority 1: Validate Core Personas with Actual LOG565 Students
- **Rationale:** The personas (Sara, Magnus, Ingrid, Prof. Eriksen) are based on assumptions. We need real user feedback to validate pain points and value propositions.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Conduct 5-10 user interviews with LOG565 students (Persona: Sara)
  - Interview 2-3 LOG565 instructors (Persona: Prof. Eriksen)
  - Validate: Do they recognize the pain points? Is the value proposition compelling?
  - Refine personas based on feedback

### Priority 2: Define MVP Success Criteria (Quantitative Metrics)
- **Rationale:** We've defined many possible metrics - we need to pick the 3-5 that matter most for MVP validation.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Select Primary Metrics: Completion Rate (≥60%), Time to Completion (45-60 min), Post-Simulation Survey Score (≥4.0/5)
  - Select Secondary Metrics: Renegotiation Rate (≥40%), Constraint Awareness (≥70%)
  - Instrument the MVP to track these metrics from day one

### Priority 3: Develop Value Proposition Testing Plan
- **Rationale:** The value prop is compelling in theory - but does it resonate with real users?
- **Next Steps:**
  - Create 3 versions of the value prop message (focused on different pain points)
  - A/B test on landing page or course announcement
  - Measure: Which version drives highest signup rate and completion rate?
  - Refine messaging based on results

### Priority 4: Build Instructor Onboarding Materials
- **Rationale:** Instructors (Prof. Eriksen persona) are gatekeepers - if they don't assign it, students won't use it.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Create a 1-page "Instructor Guide" explaining how to integrate simulation into LOG565
  - Develop sample assignment prompt: "Complete the Nye Hædda simulation and submit your final plan + 500-word reflection on your negotiation strategies"
  - Provide sample assessment rubric
  - Make instructor adoption as frictionless as possible

### Priority 5: Design Post-Simulation Learning Reflection
- **Rationale:** The simulation alone isn't enough - users need structured reflection to consolidate learning.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Add a "Reflection Prompt" after plan approval:
    - "What was your most challenging negotiation? Why?"
    - "What strategy worked best for you? What didn't work?"
    - "If you were to do this again, what would you do differently?"
  - Offer optional export of negotiation log for portfolio/coursework
  - This bridges the simulation experience to academic assessment

## 6. Session Reflection

### What Worked Well:

1. **Multi-Persona Approach:**
   - Defining 4 distinct personas (Sara, Magnus, Ingrid, Prof. Eriksen) revealed different value propositions for different user segments
   - This prevents the trap of designing for a generic "student" and missing key motivations

2. **Jobs-to-Be-Done Framework:**
   - Separating functional, emotional, and social jobs clarified WHY users would choose this simulation
   - Emotional jobs (build confidence, reduce fear of failure) are as important as functional jobs (practice negotiation)

3. **Value Proposition Canvas:**
   - Systematically mapping pains → pain relievers and gains → gain creators ensured the simulation design addresses real user needs
   - Severity ratings (⚠️⚠️⚠️) helped prioritize which pains to solve first (MVP vs. future)

4. **Detailed User Journey Map:**
   - Walking through Sara's complete journey (discovery → crisis → success → transfer to real world) made the value proposition tangible
   - Identified specific moments where the simulation could fail (e.g., AI too easy, user gives up during crisis phase)

5. **Comprehensive Success Metrics:**
   - Defining metrics across engagement, learning outcomes, satisfaction, and technical performance ensures holistic evaluation
   - Avoided the trap of measuring only "easy" metrics (time to completion) and ignoring "important" metrics (negotiation strategy diversity)

### Areas for Further Exploration:

1. **Persona Validation:**
   - Are Sara, Magnus, Ingrid, and Prof. Eriksen accurate representations of real users?
   - What did we miss in our assumptions about pain points or motivations?
   - → Requires user interviews with actual LOG565 students and instructors

2. **AI Persona Calibration:**
   - How stubborn should the AI suppliers be?
   - If too easy: simulation is trivial, no learning
   - If too hard: users give up in frustration
   - → Requires playtesting with different AI "resistance levels"

3. **Scope Creep Risk:**
   - The brainstorming generated many ideas (AI learning, dynamic events, multiplayer, instructor dashboards)
   - How do we stay disciplined about MVP scope?
   - → Need a ruthless prioritization framework (e.g., MoSCoW: Must/Should/Could/Won't)

4. **Business Model (Future):**
   - The proposal states "Free Registered Users" with "No payment walls"
   - Is this sustainable long-term? (Gemini API costs scale with usage)
   - → Might need to explore: University site licenses, freemium tiers, or grant funding

5. **Localization Impact:**
   - UI in Norwegian, but AI agents also speak Norwegian
   - Does this limit international scalability?
   - → For MVP, this is fine (target is Norwegian LOG565 courses). For future, consider English version.

### Recommended Follow-up:

1. **User Interview Script:**
   - Develop a structured interview script to validate personas with 5-10 LOG565 students
   - Key questions:
     - "What's the hardest part of learning project management for you?"
     - "Have you ever practiced negotiating with stakeholders? How?"
     - "What would make you feel confident enough to take on a real PM role?"

2. **Metrics Implementation Plan:**
   - Work with the development team to instrument the MVP for metric tracking
   - Ensure `chat_logs`, `plan_entries`, and `games` tables capture all necessary data
   - Build a basic analytics dashboard to monitor metrics in real-time

3. **Competitor Analysis:**
   - Deep dive into existing PM simulations (SimProject, Harvard Business School PM Simulation, Marketplace Simulations)
   - What do they do well? What are their weaknesses?
   - Refine value proposition based on competitive gaps

4. **Pilot Testing Plan:**
   - Identify 1-2 LOG565 instructors willing to pilot the simulation with a small group (10-20 students)
   - Collect qualitative feedback (what worked, what frustrated you, what surprised you)
   - Iterate on MVP before broader launch

### New Questions that Arose:

1. **How do we balance challenge with accessibility?**
   - Some students (Sara) will be theory-strong but negotiation-weak
   - Some students (Magnus) will be negotiation-strong but PM-theory-weak
   - Should the simulation adapt to user skill level? Or maintain consistent difficulty?

2. **What happens after the simulation?**
   - Once a user completes it successfully, is there any reason to replay?
   - Should we add:
     - Difficulty settings (harder constraints, more stubborn AI)?
     - Alternative scenarios (different construction projects)?
     - Leaderboards (fastest completion, lowest cost, etc.)?
   - → For MVP, one-and-done is fine. For retention, need replayability features.

3. **How do we prevent "gaming" the system?**
   - If students discover that the AI always accepts a certain argument, they'll just copy-paste it
   - How do we ensure the AI has enough variability to prevent pattern exploitation?
   - → Requires robust prompt engineering and testing

4. **What's the learning transfer effectiveness?**
   - Does success in the simulation actually correlate with real-world PM competence?
   - How do we measure this?
   - → Requires longitudinal study: track students who use the simulation vs. those who don't, compare their performance in real PM roles 1-2 years later
   - → This is a PhD thesis-level research question, not an MVP priority, but worth noting for future academic partnerships

## 7. Summary: Core Audience & Value Proposition

### Primary Audience: LOG565 Project Management Students (Persona: Sara)
- **Age:** 22-25
- **Pain:** Theory-practice gap; never practiced real negotiation or data validation
- **Gain:** Confidence in PM skills, portfolio artifacts, ability to discuss in class
- **Value Prop:** "Practice the soft skills (negotiation, iteration, trade-offs) that your textbook teaches but your case studies don't let you experience."

### Secondary Audience: Career Switchers (Persona: Magnus)
- **Age:** 28-35
- **Pain:** Time constraints, need practical skills fast, confidence gap
- **Gain:** Focused learning (under 1 hour), portfolio piece, reduced performance anxiety
- **Value Prop:** "Build PM negotiation skills and get a tangible portfolio artifact in under an hour - no fluff, just the hard skills employers actually care about."

### Stakeholder Audience: Instructors (Persona: Prof. Eriksen)
- **Age:** 40-60
- **Pain:** Students can't apply theory to messy real-world scenarios; limited practical training opportunities
- **Gain:** Higher student engagement, discussion-worthy learning artifacts, turnkey tool
- **Value Prop:** "Give your students hands-on negotiation experience without the overhead of setting up role-plays or field trips - just assign it, and they'll come to class with real stories to discuss."

### Unified Value Proposition:
**"Nye Hædda Simulator uses AI to recreate the chaotic, negotiation-heavy Planning Phase that traditional PM education skips. Practice gathering real project data from stubborn suppliers, make hard trade-offs under strict constraints, and learn that planning is an iterative process - not a one-time template exercise. It's the soft skills training that case studies can't provide and real projects can't afford to teach through failure."**
