# Purpose

The task is to create a proposal.md following the example in @docs/data/proposal-example.md for creating a project management simulation web page application.

The web application is a simplification of a complete project management simulation web site.

The main idea of the simulation:

* The player`s main task is to collect necessary data to be able to produce a Gantt chart and critical path
* The collection of data happens through asking the suppliers of necessary numbers for earliest start, latest and, costs etc to do a task
* The total plan will exceed the porject limits, forcing the project manager to renegiotiate for any of the tasks data
* The app will use AI to take the role of the suppliers, using a predetermined schdeule and costs and a room for negiations. This will give the players a new way of simulating real project management.
* The MVP is restricted to ONLY collecting task data, the following will be given:
  * Set of requirements
  * WBS with precedence constraints
* Once the player has been able to get a porject plan within the scope, the simulation is over with a projected end date and total cost

## Instructions

* The web page to be created is in Norwegian
* The proposal to be created is writting in English
* Use the same tech stacks as in the proposal example, where applicable
* This application will NOT have any payment or instructor role, ONLY free registered users

## Workflow

1. Read and learn the context about the simulation:
   1. The fictious simulation case: @docs/data/project-description.pdf togheter with a concept sketch: @docs/data/concept.pdf
   2. About the simulation, when it was run as a MS teams application in an earlier course: @docs/data/Simulering av byggeprosjekt vår 2025.pdf
   3. Read the proposed requirements to be used in the simulation: @docs/data/krav-spec.pdf
   4. Read the proposed WBS with suggested start, end and costs: @docs/data/wbs.pdf
2. Read the example proposal: @docs/data/proposal-example.md
3. Read the checklist: @docs/data/proposal-checklist.yaml
4. Write a complete MVP @docs/proposal.md based on the context above.
5. Evaluate the proposal based in the checklist. Improve the proposal untill the checklist is perfect.
