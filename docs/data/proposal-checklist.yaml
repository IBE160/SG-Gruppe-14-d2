# Scoring Rules
scoring_rules:
  - "Sum all weighted scores to get final grade (0-100)"
  - "Round final grade to nearest integer"
  - "Consider AI-assisted development accelerates coding but not architectural complexity"
  - "1.5 months = ~6 weeks of development time"
  - "Projects scoring < 70 should be discussed with instructor before proceeding"
  - "Balance ambition with deliverability - incomplete projects score poorly"
  - "Clarity is valued over cleverness - specific details are essential"
