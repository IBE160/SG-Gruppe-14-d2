Claude commands

PERMISSIONS
You can start a session with bypassPermissions mode using a command-line flag:

  claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

  Or alternatively:

  claude --permission-mode bypassPermissions

  Both of these will skip all permission prompts for just that session without changing your permanent settings. The session-specific flag overrides any settings in your config files and only applies to that one session.

FILE USAGE IN PROMPTING
● Here are the ways you can provide files to me in Claude Code:

  Quick Methods

  1. Use the @ symbol (easiest):
  @/path/to/document.pdf - add some text to this
  Or with relative paths:
  @./document.pdf - add a header to this

  2. Drag and drop:
  - Simply drag a file into the Claude Code terminal window

  3. Copy and paste:
  - Copy a file and paste it with Ctrl+V (Windows/Linux)

  4. Just mention the file path:
  Read this PDF and add text: C:\Users\morte\Documents\myfile.pdf

  For PDFs Specifically

  I can read PDFs directly using my Read tool. Once you reference a PDF file (using any method above), I can:
  - Extract and analyze the text content
  - Help you create modified versions
  - Generate new files with added text

  For example, you could say:
  @C:\Users\morte\Documents\report.pdf - add a title page with "Annual Report 2025"

  The @ symbol method is usually the most convenient for interactive sessions.
